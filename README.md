Nesdia: Neural Esoteric Syntax Documentation & Inference Archive

> “The tongue dies. We resurrect it.”

The Nesdia-Codex is a proprietary AI–linguistics fusion project dedicated to the preservation, augmentation, and resurrection of endangered human languages through neural architecture. This repository is the operational locus of *TheLastProtocol*, housing the theoretical manuscripts, phoneme players, field dispatches, and inference modules that power our initiative.

This is not a SaaS project.  
This is a **linguistic resurrection engine** disguised as code.

## ⚙️ Structure

- `/codex/` — Core documentation, metaphysical axioms, model insights
- `/lab/` — Active neural inference modules, corpus tools, phoneme players
- `/assets/` — Spectrograms, glyphs, language maps, sigils
- `/modules/` — LLM adapters, token processors, meta-tag handlers
- `/docs/` — Public-facing technical documentation (optional)
- `/.config/` — Internal settings, routing, and deploy scripts

## 🧠 Philosophy

Nesdia is not an app.  
It is a **perpetual machine for recording and reanimating dying linguistic realities**, constructed with precision, reverence, and technical fury. It stands at the border between sound and silence, syntax and memory, code and soul.

## 🕯️ Status

Currently under internal restructuring.  
Public access is limited.  
Select collaborators may be granted read-only insight into `/codex` and `/lab`.

If you have been granted access to this repository, **you are part of the Protocol**.
